# 🥪 Deli2Go - Website Redesign 🍴

Welcome to **Deli2Go's refreshed web experience** — a clean, aesthetic revamp of the original design.  
This version aims to be visually pleasing, more intuitive, and less choppy — built with love, caffeine, and some ✨frontend magic✨.

## 🧠 Purpose

The original version of the site felt outdated and unpolished, with inconsistent spacing and visual clutter.  
I wanted to give it a facelift — something minimal, elegant, and easier on the eyes.  

This was also a personal frontend exercise — to:
- Sharpen my HTML/CSS layout skills 🧩
- Improve UI/UX decisions based on visual feedback 🎨
- Practice responsive design techniques 📱
